=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.2.0 and greater

The 4.4 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 4.2.2 to 4.2.3) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

The support for C<jsmin> (via the C<$JSMinPath> configuration) has been
removed in favor of a built-in solution.

You can now split settings from F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> into separate files under
an F<etc/RT_SiteConfig.d/> directory. All files ending in C<.pm> will be
parsed, in alphabetical order, after the main F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> is loaded.

=item *

Custom fields with categories will be split out into hierarchical custom
fields.
